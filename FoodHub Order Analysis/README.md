# FoodHub Order Analysis

## Executive Summary

### Problem summary:  
The goal of this analysis was to gain insights into customer demand across various restaurants to help FoodHub enhance its customer experience and business performance. 
FoodHub earns revenue through commissions on orders, meaning higher order volumes directly increase profits. 
Therefore, the key question was: <u>What are the customers' preferences?</u> By answering this question, we aim to better understand how to attract and retain more customers.   
To achieve this, I have analyzed data consisting of order IDs, customer IDs, restaurant names, cuisine types, order prices, order ratings, delivery periods, 
and preparation and delivery times. This data allowed me to form a basic understanding of customer demand regarding food ordering. 4
The dataset included nearly 1,900 customer orders. Customer feedback could have been accessed in two ways:
- Direct: Ratings (1 – 5),
- Indirect: Number of orders placed (popularity).
Analyzing these factors and their relationships with the collected data provides insights into possible business development directions.

### Conclusions:
- <u>The most popular cuisine is American</u> (30.87%), followed by Japanese, Italian, and Chinese, which together cover 83% of all orders.
- The five most popular restaurants serve American, Japanese, and Chinese food. The most popular restaurant, <u>‘Shake Shack’</u>, accounts for approximately 11% of all orders.
-	Customers tend to order cheaper meals, but price does not significantly impact the given ratings.
- <u>Most orders are placed on weekends (71%)</u>, involving around 24% more restaurants than on weekdays.
-	In general, <u>orders placed on weekends are delivered faster</u>, with an average reduction in delivery time of around 21%.
-	<u>39% of all orders are not rated</u>. Among the rated orders, approximately 51% received the highest score of 5. No ratings are lower than 3.
-	Ratings do not seem to directly depend on delivery or preparation time.
-	Since there is no significant relationship between price and ratings, we can assume that customers value other factors more, e.g. the quality of food.

### Recommendations:
-	The significant difference between weekend and weekday orders suggests potential for business expansion. Introducing special offers, such as happy hours or free delivery on weekdays, could encourage more orders during these times.
-	One restaurant, ‘The Meatball Shop’, offers both American and Italian cuisine, with Italian being preferred. As the second most popular restaurant, this suggests potential in partnering with restaurants that offer diverse cuisines.
-	The company should develop strategies to encourage more customers to provide ratings. Unrated orders offer no feedback, making it harder to meet customers' needs.
-	While overall ratings provide some insight into customer satisfaction, introducing separate categories, e.g. for food quality and delivery time, would offer a more detailed understanding of customer preferences.
-	Collecting information about the location of restaurants and more detailed data on the timing of orders would be beneficial. This data could help identify new customer bases, potential restaurant partners, and opportunities for targeted special offers.
-	The highest average ratings are for Spanish, Thai, and Indian cuisines. Leveraging the strong ratings of these top cuisines can attract more customers, especially since these cuisines are not among the most popular.
